libxdo-dev (1:3.20140805.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * xdo_get_keysym_charmap() was introduced in libxdo.so.3, version
    3.20130104.1.  It was removed as of 3.20140805.1.
  
    This is an incompatible change, but no one was using this symbol so
    the SONAME was not bumped.  If you were using this symbol, and this
    breaks things for you, please file a bug against the xdotool package
    with a description of what you were doing with it, and i'll try to
    figure out a way forward.
